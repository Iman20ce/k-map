# k-map
Here we have tried to develop an algorithm for 4 variable k-map, it's an pictorial representation to minimize boolean expression. 
When we will run the particular file we will find the 'X' marks around.
In the left side of the panel there is reset and compute button. When we press on the 'X' button once we get '0', when we press again we get
'1'. Then after pressing compute button we will get the required output. If we want to reset all we may press reset button.
